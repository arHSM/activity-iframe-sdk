# activity-iframe-sdk

This is a fully typed reimplementation of the Discord Activity Iframe SDK
provided to developers working on VC activities for Discord.\
The source under [`./lib`](./lib/) tries to comply with the actual SDK as much as
possible, despite some inconsistencies if you want to use this framework then it
is guaranteed to be a drop-in replacement for the official SDK.
